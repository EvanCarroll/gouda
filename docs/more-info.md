Gouda expects a few things about your docs:

  * All doc files must be Markdown-formatted (see [Pandoc's
    Markdown](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown)).

  * All doc filenames must end in ".md".

  * You must have an index.md file, plus at least two other doc files
    (otherwise your chapter navigation area won't be very interesting).

  * Your doc files must begin with a header block like this:

        % Title for this Doc

    You can also add additional lines to that block for author and date (see
    [Title Block](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#title-block)).

  * If gouda finds a `_copyright` file in the docs dir, it will place
    its contents as-is into the footer of every html chapter. This
    file will usually contain something like: `Your Name, 2013`.



# What it Does

Gouda generates cross-linked html files from your markdown-formatted
doc files.  The resulting html files will reside in the same directory
as the ".md" files.

Gouda will also generate a default "styles.css" file, which you can
customize, or use as-is (this site uses it as-is).

Each ".md" file should represent one "chapter". To rearrange the order
in which the chapters are listed in the ToC, edit the autogenerated
"toc.conf" file and re-run gouda.py.

The index.md file is special, and it's required. It serves as the
"front page" of your documentation. Also, it's title (in the "[title
block](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#title-block)")
should be the name of your project â€” it will be shown in the header of
every generated page.

<a id="simple-template"/>
As a simple template, you might start your docs looking like this:

~~~~
% Title Goes Here
% Author Name
% 2013-02-04

Some text.

An H1 Heading
=============

Some text.

An H2 Heading
-------------

etc.
~~~~

The title after the "%" is what will appear in the ToC (except for
index.md, the title of which will be used as the name of your
documentation project).

Example](quick-markdown-example.html).

Once you've got some docs written, you might use rsync/ftp/scp your
docs dir to the web to publish them.
